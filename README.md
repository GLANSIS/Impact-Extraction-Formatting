# GLANSIS IMPACT EXTRACTOR & FORMATTER
This script extracts impact data from the GLANSIS impact data tables, formats the impact descriptions into bullet points with in-text citations for GLANSIS Organism Impact Assessments, and creates a reference section. The script exports an Excel file with the impacts and a Word document with the references. It uses various libraries to manage data tables, pull and parse HTML content, edit text strings, create and edit Word documents, and automate web browser interactions. Users need to enter a species ID, optionally an impact ID, and the script will gather and format the impact data, apply in-text citations, and export the results.
